# Energy Data Analysis Visualization and Outlier Detection Using the Julia Programming Language

Dataset

The dataset (“households-24hrs.tsv”) is a Tab Separated Values (TSV) file that contains the power consumption records of 241 households measured every 30 minutes over 24 hours. Note the format of the spreadsheet: each household makes a column of 48 entries. 

Project Tasks

1. Visual exploratory analysis. Plot out the 48-entry power consumption data and generate a few plots as examples. Display the average consumption vector and the standard deviation vector.

2. PCA and visualization. Carry out PCA and visualize the 48-dim data using the first two principal components.

3. Online PCA. Use the first 20 data vectors to obtain the mean vector m and the covariance matrix.

4. Outlier test using online PCA.
